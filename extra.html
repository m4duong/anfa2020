                Produced in 2003, Beyond Intuition tells the story of how ANFA
                started as a nonprofit organization. It is a tribute to John
                Paul Eberhard’s vision and the many architects and scientists
                who joined him in making his foresight a reality.

              <p>
                ANFA VOICES is a new project headed by Dr. Kristine Mun to
                create a series of short commentaries presented by our Advisory
                Council members and the Board of Directors expressing their
                views on Neuroscience for Architecture to our global audience.
                It is a way to share openly and to discuss from their personal
                experience how neuroscience and architecture are connected, why
                we need to consider this relationship as relevant and what kind
                of research directions they have taken with this topic. Set in a
                casual manner, like a conversation between colleagues, the
                VOICES series will be ongoing to open up dialogues between ANFA
                and the public at large as we build our community of
                researchers, scientists, architects and designers interested in
                the field of Neuroscience for Architecture.

                School of Medicine. Over the last 15 years, she have actively
                participated in the development of two emerging progressive
                fields: neuroaesthetics and the science of learning. These
                dynamic and evolving interdisciplinary disciplines offer the
                promise of rigorous research to practice and enhanced outcomes,
                across a range of societal issues.

                Colin Ellard is a professor of psychology, specializing in
                cognitive neuroscience, at the University of Waterloo in Canada.
                He is particularly interested in understanding the emotional
                effects of architectural settings, which he explores in both
                field settings and in synthetic environments using immersive
                virtual reality. Ellard received his BSc in psychology and
                philosophy at the University of Toronto and his doctorate at
                Western University.

                  COVID-19 has had a pervasive impact on the way that human
                  beings interact amongst each other and with the built
                  environment. Rural villages and densely populated cities have
                  been equally affected. Join one of two live discussion forums
                  assessing the future and consider how research in cognitive
                  science and neuroscience may bring about answers. The
                  questions to be addressed during these forums will cover
                  spatial confinement, reduced quality and quantity of social
                  interaction, loss of privacy, feeling of reduced agency (power
                  to control), reduced environmental richness and novelty,
                  diminished sense of well-being, and increased stress.
